# ipverse-rir-ip

This is a drop-in replacement for the files currently (but not much longer) available at iverse.net.  

Shoulnd't be used for geo-locating since the RIR data is too generic.

## How to use

To download the delegated subnets for Switzerland, try:
```$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipverse/rir-ip/master/country/ch/ipv4-aggregated.txt```

The files are available in JSON format as well, just replace the extension with .json.
